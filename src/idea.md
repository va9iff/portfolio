on pc, just hover to release. that's easy
but on phone, clicking right brings card from right,
clicking left brings card from left.
you'll have event listeners for mousemove and touchstart.

or another idea is that when you tap, it just swipes left.
when you hit the last pic, it swipes all to start.

or maybe just have a small, or dynamic click range. 
depending on how many cards you swiped.

additional: hold to view full screen carousel.. but naa
iphone's gallery-like scroll in bottom which switches the fullscreen image too.

but instagram's dots hold may be the solution !!!!
also consider simple swipe.
